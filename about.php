        <p>
            The availability of well-equipped and functional laboratories for multi-disciplinary research purposes is
            condition sine qua non for scientific development of developing nations, Nigeria inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The University Central Science Laboratory (CSL) was established in 1999 as a cost-optimizing innovation for
            providing modern expensive facilities, centrally, for qualitative instruction at both the undergraduate and
            postgraduate levels to enhance the quality of research in a wide range of science disciplines. Hitherto,
            individual departments procured instruments/equipment leading to duplication of expensive facilities with
            no spare parts to service them and researchers had no idea what equipment/facilities existed in other
            departments/units. The CSL was thus established to address theseproblems by pooling the resources under
            one management and placing them at the disposal of both staff and students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Facilities that are considered expensive but of priority to primary academic programmes of multidisciplinary
            application and require support of infrastructure are selected for management by the CSL in a purpose-built
            CSL building,backed up with electricity generators of 114 and 22.5KVA respectively in the event of power
            failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The CSL is categorized into five sections according to spatial location of items of equipment viz:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Biology Laboratory</li>
                <li>Chemistry Laboratory</li>
                <li>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Laboratory</li>
                <li>Microscopy laboratory including Scanning Electron microscope (SEM)</li>
                <li>Biotechnology Laboratory</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The management of the laboratory is under a Director with Lab conveners/Coordinators in charge of the
            various sections listed above. Since inception, over 36 science-based departments/units within the
            University regularly use the facilities and the main users are members of staff, postgraduate and
            undergraduate students for research and final year projects respectively. Apart from providing needed
            facilities, the CSL has impacted positively on the Science disciplines through attraction of undergraduate
            students for industrial attachment and providing assistance in meeting accreditation requirements of
            professional regulatory bodies and those of the National Universities Commission.Over 20 other
            universities/research institutes across the nation make use of the services of the Laboratory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Essentially, the Center has been able to attract a reasonable cross section of users countrywide. The
            CSL has also emerged as a model for other universities in Nigeria. In addition, regular hands-on training
            workshops are held from time to time to update the knowledge of users. The CSL has been a beneficiary of
            the Carnegie Corporation of New York support from 2003 to date for sustenance of its activities, which
            include acquisition of some additional items of equipment and accessories, replacing aging ones, carrying
            out maintenance services for specialized items of equipment as well as, training opportunities for CSL
            staff members and the users.
